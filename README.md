This repo creates a local DBs on my machine using SQLITE.

The SQLite DB that contains a patient table with 8 columns.

Dummy patient data table is created using sqlite3.

The creations of fake patient data is coded in the files "createDB.py" and "connectDB.py"

Inside the flask app, a route called ‘/patients’ display the list of
patients retrieved from the SQlite DB.
